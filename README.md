# JavaScript to TypeScript

What better way to learn TypeScript than to manually convert it over from JavaScript?

In this project, your goal is to take this simple calculator app and take the javascript file and convert is into TypeScript.

Sounds easy? Go on ahead and give it a go!

Everything you need to touch is found in the script.js file, you needn't change any other file.

An example of the TypeScript answers can be found in the "solution" folder.

If you get stuck, please feel free to refer back to the TypeScript Tutorial page or to consult any other resources you feel may help.

Good luck!
